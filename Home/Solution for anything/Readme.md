    We need a solution which can pass any case.
    The result of your solution should pass for any comparison with anything.
</p>

<p>
    You should write the function "checkio" which is called with one argument, the result will be
    compared with some other data (==, !=, etc) and the result of that comparison should be True.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Some data. Maybe that data over there.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The something as a something-else.
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio({}) != [] # True
checkio('Hello') < 'World' # True
checkio(80) > 81 # True
checkio(re) >= re # True
checkio(re) <= math # True
checkio(5) == ord # True
    </pre>
